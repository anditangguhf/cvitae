                    My name is Andi Tangguh Kippi Nusantara. I am an Informatics college student of Parahyangan Catholic
                    University, Bandung, Indonesia. I am currently learning about Java and some web designing languages
                    such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most of my works are small college projects and tasks and currently
                    trying to improve my programming skills and quality of my works.
